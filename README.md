# ThesisMatlab
Matlab project for estimating satellite positions from raw data
## The main file contains several computations. Only the ones of interest should be run and not all in order. 
Data can also be loaded from any of the .mat files available when running the Double difference simulations
Settings for what to do in that simulation can be adjusted in the sims-struct available in the SimSettings.m-file.
###Load sims to memory before the simulations are run.
###Load some raw data to memory before running simulations
